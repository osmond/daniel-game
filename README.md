# Arcane Interfaces: Danielâ€™s Edition

> This repository contains my personal fork of [React RPG](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/react-rpg.com). I have customized the original open-source game to experiment with new mechanics and content. Huge thanks to Andrew Steinheiser and the entire React RPG community for creating such an awesome foundation!
