# Arcane Interfaces: Danielâ€™s Edition

> This repository contains my personal fork of [React RPG](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/react-rpg.com). I have customized the original open-source game to experiment with new mechanics and content. Huge thanks to Andrew Steinheiser and the entire React RPG community for creating such an awesome foundation!

## Project Overview

Arcane Interfaces is a browser-based RPG powered by React and Vite. This fork adds new mechanics and content while keeping the original project's lightweight design.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (see `.nvmrc` for the recommended version)
- npm

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and launch the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

Unit tests use Jest. After installing dependencies you can run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Building for Production

Create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
